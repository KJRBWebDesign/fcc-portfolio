          I wasn't one of those kids who excelled in school. Very, very far from it. But I'd always had a thirst for learning. In my early years, I would soak up the knowledge my adult counterparts would speak when they conversated with one another. Yes, I know. It seems kind of creepy in retrospect(<em>especially for my family</em>). But even then I had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, I just didn't know where to look. So I looked everywhere. I narrowed my search down at around thirteen to one thing: <em>computers.</em> I love em&#39;. Everything about them is mystical and magic, but when you break things down into smaller problems it becomes quite simple. Completing my first development project was like giving a child their first toy. The only difference being my toy was actually quite awful. But I loved it. I continued to make more toys until eventually, I made <em>good</em> toys, and here we are today.

             I'm familiar with the development process in it's entirety. Although there may be certain projects I may not be able to complete myself(i.e Mobile App Development), I do know how these projects are brought together and how to plan them. I've worked on projects ranging from e-shops for large consulting firms to peddle their ware, to small scale restaurateurs who just want to get their information on the web. Whatever your internet-inclinations may be, there's definitely something I can help you with!

             I reside in Derby, Connecticut, USA. If you'd like to chat about your project or business, please feel free to contact me below or on any of my social media platforms.
